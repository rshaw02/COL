# Packs

Packs contain game content like cards and trophies which can be used to customize your game. This content is encoded as JSON data and stored in files.

This document provides an overview of the format of this data as well as how to write your own packs.


## Structure

A pack .json file contains a single JSON object acting as the root of all the pack's contents.

Aside from the contents, there are a number of required and optional metadata fields.

```json
{
    "id": "example_pack",
    "name": "Example Pack",
    "author": "Nicholas Fleck",
    "accent_color": "white",
    "accent_background": "#333",
    "license": "",
    "license_url": "",
    "cards": [],
    "trophies": []
}
```
